 **Detecting faces (and bodies) and drawing them with lines**

 This is a series of programs bringing to fruition an art idea of mine -- recreating the human body/face with a meticulous orchestration of straight lines.

 The idea grew into the motivation of capturing and recreating the contour of our bodies through processing the different pixel regions (shades) that are cast on us as we interact with light. With precise calculations to deduce the length, color, and location of numerous straight lines, the human body becomes art.

 Run 'main.py', which has an interface to all the other (updated and stable) scripts.
